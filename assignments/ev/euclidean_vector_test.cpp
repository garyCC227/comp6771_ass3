                           == Explanation and rational of testing ==
    this test will have the coverage:
    1. function coverage: all the functions will be called in this test
    2. branch/ statement/ expression coverage:
        I will cover all the possible input as much as I can, so guarantee that
        all the statement/expression/if_else branch would be implemented(in this function).
            such as
            (1) type (int, double, double/int)
            (2) weired input(e.g. 0-dimesnion vector)
            (3) special input that will call the if_else branch (or others expression/ statement)
            (4) normal input
            e.t.c
    and with 1. and 2. , we hopefully we can cover all the situations, then we will compare the my
    output with the expected output. Finally, if all match, we could say all my functions work
 properly.

    - for const vector:
        we will test for any const vector will have valid const memeber function to call.
        but some of methods both have setter and getter, then I will only test for getter,
        since Clion will tell us setter cannot be use, since we have const vector object.
